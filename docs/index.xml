      <description>Go is a wonderful programming language, nestled comfortably in between low-level languages like C or Rust, and higher level languages like Python or Ruby. The convenience one gains by doing systems programming in Go, thanks to perks like syntactic simplicity and first-class concurrency, is offset by repetitive error handling, lack of direct memory access, and a few glaring omissions from the standard library (generics and binary literals come to mind.)</description>

      <description>Before dealing with the nitty-gritty of the EC2 API for Golang (and boy is it gritty,) it will help to understand the basics of mgmt and how resources are implemented. Mgmt is an open-source event-based config management solution written entirely in Golang, based on a Directed Acyclic Graph model. It is the brain-child of @purpleidea, who maintains the project and provides mentoring to new contributors (myself included.) Mgmt&amp;rsquo;s resource modules each define methods to watch, verify and change the state of any resources the user may need to maintain, as well as any relationships to other resources where appropriate.</description>

      <description>Thanks for stopping by. I guess you&amp;rsquo;re here because you wanted to know more about me or some of my work. I&amp;rsquo;m a developer with a focus on automation, config management, devops and open-source. My weapon of choice is Go, and my tools are sharp. Check back here often, to follow my adventures in IT.</description>
